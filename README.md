# Intro

This is the React version of the benronkin.com website. Currently, only the /portfolio/index.html page is in react.

The metadata about the portfolio child pages is listed in articles.jsx. App.jsx imports the data and provides it to ArticleList, which uses it to create the articleListItems.
